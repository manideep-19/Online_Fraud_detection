Online Payment Fraud Detection
Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions in an online payment system using machine learning algorithms. The objective is to classify transactions as legitimate or fraudulent based on historical data and various features such as transaction amount, customer behavior, and transaction time.

Data(taken from Online Payment Fraud Detection Kaggle)
The dataset used in this project is publicly available for online payment fraud detection. A typical dataset may include the following features:
- Transaction Amount: The amount of money involved in the transaction.
- Transaction Time: The timestamp when the transaction occurred.
- Customer ID: A unique identifier for each customer.
- Transaction Type: The type of transaction (e.g., debit, credit).
- Merchant ID: The identifier of the merchant processing the transaction.
- Fraud Label: A binary label (0 for legitimate, 1 for fraudulent) indicating whether a transaction is fraudulent.

For this project, download the dataset from a source like Kaggle or a public financial dataset provider.

Installation

1. Clone the Repository:
2. Set Up the Environment:
   Install the required Python packages by creating a virtual environment and installing dependencies.
   bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Requirements:
   The main Python packages used are:
   - pandas
   - numpy
   - scikit-learn
   - matplotlib
   - seabor

4. Download the Dataset:
   Place the dataset (`transactions.csv` or similar) in the `data/` folder.

 Usage

1. Data Preprocessing:
   Run the notebook to preprocess the dataset:
   bash
   jupyter notebook fraud_detection.ipynb
   This will clean and prepare the data for training.

2. Train the Model:
   Train various machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.) on the dataset.
   bash
   python train_model.py
   
3. Evaluate the Model:
   The script will output the modelâ€™s performance metrics:
   - Accuracy
   - Precision
   - Recall
   - F1-Score
   bash
   python evaluate_model.py

4. Making Predictions:
   Use the trained model to predict whether new transactions are fraudulent.
   bash
   python predict.py --input new_transactions.csv
